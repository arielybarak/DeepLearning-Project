will learn to identify
**Geometry traits** 
Room size, sensor's hight, distance from sink, shower, bathroom, 
- window? less echo but adds outside noise - crucial. out_noise rate (problem to measure in short time). Possible solution is to initiate sampling periods in differen hours when nobody is in the room.
**physics traits** 
echo, wall traits, and more

* water sounds:  Modeled as a distributed source. One source at the shower head (2.0m) and one at the floor (0.0m) to simulate the dual nature of shower noise (hiss vs. rumble).

* Validation: We will look for any released pre-trained models or feature sets from P2MFDS to benchmark our acoustic model against their radar-based results.
