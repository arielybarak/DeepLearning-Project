# Project Roadmap: High-Level Milestones

## 1. Data & Representation
*   **Goal:** Create a robust synthetic dataset of bathroom falls vs. water noise and select the best audio feature extraction method (MFCC/MFE).

## 2. Baseline Development
*   **Goal:** Build and train "standard" supervised models—comparing custom TinyML architectures against pre-trained backbones.

## 3. Advanced Paradigms
*   **Goal:** Implement and test experimental tracks: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and the One-Shot Calibration logic.

## 4. Hardware Optimization
*   **Goal:** Shrink the winning models using pruning and quantization to fit within the 16MB Flash/8MB RAM constraints.

## 5. Final Benchmarking
*   **Goal:** Run the final comparison of all models (Accuracy vs. Resource usage) and select the optimal candidate for deployment.
